 🧠 MindContacts – Your Memory's Best Friend

> "Because your brain has better things to remember."

Welcome to **MindContacts**, a handcrafted contact book application built with ❤️ using Vue 3, Vue Router 4, Vite, and the humble power of browser localStorage. Designed to look clean, run fast, and work offline — this app doesn't just store contacts; it stores **connections**.

 🎯 The Mission

In a world of cloud logins and bloated apps, MindContacts is a lightweight, single-page contact manager that respects the user’s time, data, and device. It’s a pocket-sized memory bank — no server needed.

This project was created as part of a Web Development IV challenge to master:

- Vue 3 Composition API
- Vue Router 4 for managing multiple views
- Local Storage as a front-end-only database
- Vite for super-fast dev experience
